A project done TU MÃ¼nchen looking at Simple Rotations as an alternative to Householder reflections in the QR factorization. Showing experimental results on the accuracy of the MATLAB implemented qr algorith using Householder Reflection in comparison to an own implementation using Simple Rotations. This is based on work done by Klaus Diepold, Matthias Kissel, Patrick Dewilde on generalized rotations. 

This repository includes a MATLAB file 

SimpleRotations.m 
Run this file to execute the experimental testing and plot the results. 

Simple Rotations.pdf
the Paper giving background, explaining the test method and displaying the results.
